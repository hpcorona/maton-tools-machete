machete
=======

Machete platform, is basically a game engine that allow me to create
games.

It is not feature complete, but features are built as needed.

The philosophy is to keep it small, and simple and auto-contained.

You will find a lot of basic data structures there, that i will someday
replace with STL classes, because at the start the engine was meant
not to depend on STL, but now i think it was a mistake. Still, i want
to keep the engine as compact as possible, i don't like to have
1,000 dependencies just to make it compile something.
