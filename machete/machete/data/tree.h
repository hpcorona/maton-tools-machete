          // black is restored. Hence when the near nephew's tree is moved to be a 
          // sibling of current on the final rotation, its black node count is 
          // unchanged, even if the pre-final-rotation sibling had been red.
          // Moreover, the above operations introduce no double red violations.
          // So, the only problem is that the black node count on current's "far" 
          // nephew before final rotation (which is current's parent's sibling after 
          // rotation) will be reduced by 1. This is easily taken care of by making 
          // the "far" nephew black if it had been red. Doing so also eliminates 
          // the possibility of a double red violation due to the former sibling 
          // becoming red.
          // But, if the "far" nephew had been black, a red must be moved into the 
          // "far" nephew side from the "near" nephew (this is possible since there 
          // must be at least one red nephew) by a preliminary rotation around the 
          // sibling. That red could be set to black to increase the black node 
          // count on the sibling side. But if the parent were also set to black 
          // from red, as described above, the count will be increased too much. 
          // Luckily, the afore mentioned policy of setting the sibling's color to 
          // that of its parent before the final rotation ensures this does not happen.
          
          // Thus, there are two or three action steps depending on whether current's
          // "far" nephew is black before any rotations take place:
          
          // [5.3.1] If the "far" nephew is black, rotate in that direction around 
          // the sibling. This is the preliminary rotation referred to above. 
          // Current's new (pre-final-rotation) sibling is its old (pre-preliminary-rotation)

          // the potential problem that the black node count of paths through current's 
          // (pre-preliminary-rotation) "far" nephew become 1 short once the black node 
          // is rotated into current's path (after the final rotation). By rotating
